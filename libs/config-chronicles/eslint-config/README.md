## ES Lint

ESLint is a powerful tool that can help you enforce coding standards and best practices in your codebase. Here are some advantages of using ESLint:

    Consistency: ESLint can enforce a consistent code style across your codebase, making it easier to read and maintain.

    Catching errors: ESLint can catch common errors and mistakes that might otherwise go unnoticed. This can help improve code quality and prevent bugs from making it into production.

    Customization: ESLint provides a wide range of configuration options that allow you to customize the rules to your specific needs. This can include things like enforcing specific language features, preventing the use of certain APIs, and more.

    Integration: ESLint can be integrated into your development workflow through tools like VS Code or your build process, making it easy to catch errors and enforce rules as you work.

    Standardization: By using ESLint, you can establish a standard coding style and best practices across your organization or team. This can help improve code quality and maintainability over time.

## Combining Eslint with Prettier

When used in conjunction with Prettier, ESLint can provide even more benefits. Prettier is focused on code formatting and style, while ESLint is focused on catching errors and enforcing rules. By combining these tools, you can ensure that your code is both formatted consistently and adheres to best practices and coding standards.

Overall, using ESLint and Prettier can help improve code quality, consistency, and maintainability in your codebase.
